# Thoughts

This is an app which puts your Thoughts on an image and makes it your Wallpaper.
So You Don't Forget Anything.

It consists of three Screens namely:
- Choose Backgorund Image: To choose The Background Image for your Wallpaper. It currently has only two Images but I will add more in the near future.

- Edit Image: To Edit(put some text, crop the image, or rotate it) the image.

- Set Wallpaper: This Screen asks you to set your desired wallpaper on which Screen(Home Screen, Lock Screen, or Both). It also has a checkbox to exit the app as soon as the wallpaper is set.

## Future Changes

- Planning to add more images in the Choose Background Image Section.
- A SQL database will be added for user to put their own images in the Choose Background Section.
- SQL Database will store all the edited images. So, the User can switch to previously created wallpapers without creating them again.
- Maybe I'll make an apk file for it and put it on play Store.

AND For Conclusion, I just want to say that
